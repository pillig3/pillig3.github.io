    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Befunge is a two-dimensional, toroidal, self-modifying programming language; it was created in 1993 in an attempt to create a language as difficult to compile as possible.
      Instead of having a program counter that just counts lines, Befunge features a program counter with both x and y coordinates (now called an <em>instruction pointer</em> [IP]).
      Furthermore, the IP will wrap around the top, bottom, or sides of the program, making your code a torus!
      Oh, and it's also self-modifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Befunge language, officially called <a href="//github.com/catseye/Befunge-93/blob/master/doc/Befunge-93.markdown">Befunge 93</a>, has an 80\(\times\)25-character area for input, an IP, and a stack.
      The second iteration, <a href="//quadium.net/funge/spec98.html">Befunge 98</a>, introduced a lot of fun new features; it has an unbounded input area, supports multithreading with multiple instruction pointers, and
      gives each IP a modifiable velocity vector and a stack of stacks. It also supports libraries via "fingerprints," and the specification dexcribes variants
      of Befunge in three dimensions or higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Befunge 93&ndash;&infin; is the result of me taking the parts of each that I like and putting them together.
      It's basically like Befunge 93 with unbounded size and unbounded integers (hence the name), multithreading, arbitrary IP velocities, and stacks of stacks.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Notes"> Notes </h3>
    <p>
      Back at <a href="/befunge.html">befunge.html</a>, you can run code with or without the "state,"
      which shows the code, pointers, and stack of stacks after each step.
      If the state is displayed, the "wait" time is how long to pause between steps.
      Even with a wait time of 0 it's pretty slow; running with the state hidden is much faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, even though each pointer has its own stack of stacks, the only one displayed is the one belonging to the "top" pointer
      (when a new pointer is created, it is placed onto the list of pointers one spot "below" the current pointer).
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3 id="details">Details</h3>
    <p>
      Some ways in which Befunge 93&ndash;&infin; differs from Befunge 93; most of the bonus features are borrowed from Befunge 98.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          Code is treated as a resizeable torus, with a size that is determined at runtime and may be changed.
          More specifically: viewing each character as a 1-by-1 square with integer vertices (a "cell"), we take the smallest bounding box of the cells,
          and identify the edges to create a torus. If, at some point during program execution, we write to a cell that is not in this bounding box, we take
          the new smallest bounding box containing all cells including the new one, and identify these edges to create a larger torus.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can still only write to cells with non-negative integer coordinates, so the grid is unbounded to the East and South.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arbitrarily large integers are supported, and program size is theoretically unbounded but in practice limited to \( 2^{32}-1 \approx 4.29 \) billion rows/columns (the maximum size of a JavaScript array).
        </li>
        <li>
          The IP initially moves right at a speed of one cell per step, and will remain at that speed if only Befunge-93 commands are used.
          However, it can also be set to any velocity using "x".
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of a single stack there is a stack of stacks, which initially contains one stack. All stack operations from
          Befunge 93 operate on the stack that is at the top of the stack of stacks (called the Top-Of-Stack Stack, or the TOSS).
        </li>
        <li>
          Multithreading is supported with the "t" instruction, which splits the current pointer in two.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Despite the differences, this implementation should be able to run most Befunge 93 programs, with the exception of those that depend on something strange like not being able to write
      out of bounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The available instructions.
      Most of the advanced instructions come from Befunge 98, but a lot of them work differently.
      In general, when the program can't do what an instruction specifies (e.g. there are not enough things on the stack, tries to write to a negative position), it simply
      does nothing.
      Here "IP" stands for "instruction pointer," "delta" is the velocity vector of the IP in question, the "TOSS" is the "Top Of Stack Stack," and the "SOSS" is the "Second Of Stack Stack" (the one that becomes the TOSS if the TOSS is popped off).

        Division is integer division, with the result rounded down to the nearest integer.
        Modulo behaves as it does in JavaScript, C, etc. &ndash; it will be \(\leq\)0 iff the left hand side is negative. Anything mod 0 is 0 by convention (and the Befungian philosophy of not having errors).</td>
