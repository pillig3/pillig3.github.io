    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Befunge is a two-dimensional, toroidal, self-modifying programming language; it was created in 1993 in an attempt to create a language as difficult to compile as possible.
      Instead of having a program counter that just counts lines, Befunge features a program counter with both x and y coordinates (now called an <em>instruction pointer</em> [IP]).
      Furthermore, the IP will wrap around the top, bottom, or sides of the program, making your code a torus!
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Befunge language, now called Befunge 93, has an 80\(\times\)25-character area for input, an IP, and a stack.
      The second iteration, Befunge 98, introduced a lot of fun new features; it has an unbounded input area, supports multithreading with multiple instruction pointers, and
      gives each IP a modifiable velocity vector and a stack of stacks. It also supports libraries via "fingerprints," and the specification dexcribes variants
      of Befunge in three dimensions or higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Befunge 93&ndash;&infin; is a mix of the two, with a few extra features.
      Basically it's Befunge 93 with unbounded input, arbitrarily large integers, multithreading, arbitrary IP velocities, and stacks of stacks.
      If you know Befunge 93 (a good intro is <a class="textlink" href="https://github.com/catseye/Befunge-93/blob/master/doc/Befunge-93.markdown">here</a>) you should have
      no problem with this language!
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll need Chrome to use it for now, as no other browsers support <a class="textlink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt">BigInt</a> yet.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Notes"> Notes </h3>
    <p>
      Back at <a class="textlink" href="./befunge.html">befunge.html</a>, you can run code with or without showing the "state,"
      which is a representation of the state of the program, updated after each step.
      If the state is displayed, you can pause / resume, take one step at a time, or specify a "Wait" time (how long to wait between steps).
      But even if the wait time is 0, it's still pretty slow;
      Running with the state hidden is much faster, but if the program enters an infinite loop the site will freeze.<br /> (pro tip: Chrome Menu > More Tools > Task Manager)
    </p>

    <h3 id="details">Implementation Details</h3>
    <p>
      These are the ways in which Befunge 93&ndash;&infin; differs from Befunge 93; most of the bonus features are borrowed from Befunge 98.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          Code is treated as a resizeable torus, with a size that is determined at runtime and may be changed.
          More specifically: viewing each character as a 1-by-1 square with integer vertices (a "cell"), we take the smallest bounding box of the cells,
          and identify the edges to create a torus. If, at some point during program execution, we write to a cell that is not in this bounding box, we take
          the new smallest bounding box containing all cells including the new one, and identify these edges to create a larger torus.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can still only write to cells with positive integer coordinates, so the grid is unbounded just to the East and South.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arbitrarily large integers are supported. Program size is <em>theoretically</em> also unbounded, but practically the height and width must be under \( 2^{32}-1 \approx 4.29 \) billion (the maximum size of a JavaScript array).
        </li>
        <li>
          The IP initially moves right at a speed of one cell per step, and will remain at that speed if only Befunge-93 commands are used.
          However, it can be set to any velocity using the instruction x.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of a single stack there is a stack of stacks, which initially contains one stack. All stack operations from
          Befunge 93 operate on the stack that is at the top of the stack of stacks (called the Top-Of-Stack Stack, or the TOSS).
        </li>
      </ol>
      Despite the differences, this implementation should be able to run most Befunge 93 programs, with the exception of those that depend on something strange like not being able to write
      out of bounds.
    </p>

    <h3 id="refTable">Reference Table</h3>
    <p>
      These are the available instructions.
      In general, when the program can't do what an instruction specifies (e.g. there are not enough things on the stack, tries to write to a negative position), it simply
      does nothing.
      Here "IP" stands for "instruction pointer," "delta" is the velocity vector of the IP in question, the "TOSS" is the "Top Of Stack Stack," and the "SOSS" is the "Second Of Stack Stack" (the one that becomes the TOSS if the TOSS is popped off).
