      This page gives a brief introduction to my comps (comprehensive senior project), and a few neat tidbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project focuses on the <a class="textlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial">reducibility</a> of polynomial iterates. If \( f(x) \) is an arbitrary polynomial, define the \(n\)th iterate of \(f\) to be
    </p>
    <p class="eqn">
      \( f^n(x) = \underbrace{f(f(...(f(x))))}_{n\ f\text{'s}}. \)
    </p>
    <p>
      We also say that \( f^n(x) \) is <i>newly reducible</i>, or that \(f\) has a <i>newly reducible \(n\)th iterate</i>, when all of \( f(x), f^2(x), ..., f^{n-1}(x) \) are irreducible, but \( f^n(x) \) is reducible (over \(\mathbb{Q}\), although we can study this for any field). Note that if some iterate \( f^n(x) \) is reducible, then \( f^n(x)=h_1(x)h_2(x) \), so we also have
    </p>
    <p class="eqn">
      \( f^{n+1}(x) = f^n(f(x)) = h_1(f(x))h_2(f(x)), \)
    </p>
    <p>
      so \( f^{n+1}(x) \) is also reducible. Therefore, we're searching only for the first time an iterate of \( f \) is reducible, because all iterates after that will also be reducible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example: the polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 - x - 1 \) is a famous one, being the minimal polynomial of the golden ratio \( \varphi \). It is irreducible, since \( \varphi \) is irrational. Now let's iterate it:
    </p>
    <p class="eqn">
      \( \begin{align*}
      f^2(x) &= x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1                          &\text{    is irreducible.} \\
      f^3(x) &= (x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x - 1) (x^4 - x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 1)    &\text{    is reducible!}
      \end{align*} \)
    </p>
    <p>
      So this polynomial has a newly reducible third iterate. This makes it very rare; there are only <i>eight</i> other integer polynomials of the form \( x^2 + ax + b \), with \( |a| \le 10^5, |b| \le 10^9 \), that have newly reducible third iterates.
      It's not hard to show that there are infinitely many rational polynomials of the form \( x^2 + ax + b \) with newly reducible <i>second</i> iterates, but before we began it wasn't known whether or not there are infinitely many with newly reducible <i>third</i> iterates.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, our preliminary questions were: <br />
      How many polynomials of the above form have newly reducible third iterates? <br />
      Why is the minimal polynomial of \( \varphi \) one of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time since, we've tackled some additional questions: (the last three are still unsolved) <br />
      How many rational polynomials of the form \( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) have newly reducible second iterates? <br />
      How many rational polynomials of the form \( x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) have newly reducible second iterates? <br />
      Given a degree \(d\), how many rational, monic, degree-\(d\) polynomials have newly reducible second iterates? <br />
      Are there <i>any</i> rational polynomials with newly reducible fourth iterate? <br />
      Given \( n\geq 4 \), are there any rational polynomials with newly reducible \(n\)th iterate?
    </p>
