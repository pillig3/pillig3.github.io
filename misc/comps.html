      A brief introduction to my comps (comprehensive senior project), and a few neat tidbits.
    </p>



    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This project focuses on the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial">reducibility</a> of polynomial iterates. If \( f(x) \) is an arbitrary polynomial, define the \(n\)th iterate of \(f\) to be
    </p>
    <p class="centered">
      \( f^n(x) = \underbrace{f(f(...(f(x))))}_{n\ f\text{'s}}. \)
    </p>
    <p>
      We also say that \( f^n(x) \) is <i>newly reducible</i>, or that \(f\) has a <i>newly reducible \(n\)th iterate</i>, when all of \( f(x), f^2(x), ..., f^{n-1}(x) \) are irreducible, but \( f^n(x) \) is reducible (over \(\mathbb{Q}\), although we can study this for any field). Note that if some iterate \( f^n(x) \) is reducible, then \( f^n(x)=h_1(x)h_2(x) \), so we also have
    </p>
    <p class="centered">
      \( f^{n+1}(x) = f^n(f(x)) = h_1(f(x))h_2(f(x)), \)
    </p>
    <p>
      so \( f^{n+1}(x) \) is also reducible. Therefore, we're searching only for the first time an iterate of \( f \) is reducible, because all iterates after that will also be reducible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example: the polynomial \( f(x) = x^2 - x - 1 \) is a famous one, being the minimal polynomial of the golden ratio \( \varphi \). It is irreducible, since \( \varphi \) is irrational. Now let's iterate it:
    </p>
    <p class="centered">
      \( \begin{aligned}
      f^2(x) &= x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 1                          &&\text{is irreducible.} \\
      f^3(x) &= (x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x - 1) (x^4 - x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 1)    &&\text{is reducible!}
      \end{aligned} \)
    </p>
    <p>
      So this polynomial has a newly reducible third iterate. This makes it very rare; there are only <i>eight</i> other integer polynomials of the form \( x^2 + ax + b \), with \( |a| \le 10^5, |b| \le 10^9 \), that have newly reducible third iterates.
      It's not hard to show that there are infinitely many rational polynomials of the form \( x^2 + ax + b \) with newly reducible <i>second</i> iterates, but it's more difficult to see whether there are infinitely many with newly reducible <i>third</i> iterates.
    </p>
    So, our preliminary questions were:

    <ol type="1">
      <li> How many polynomials of the above form have newly reducible third iterates? </li>
      <li> Why is the minimal polynomial of \( \varphi \) one of them? </li>
    </ol>

    In the time since, we've tackled some additional questions, though they remain unsolved:

    <ol type="1" start="3">
      <li>
        Given a degree \(d\), how many rational, monic, degree-\(d\) polynomials have newly reducible second iterates?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are there <i>any</i> rational polynomials with newly reducible fourth iterate?
      </li>
      <li>
        Given \( n\geq 4 \), are there any rational polynomials with newly reducible \(n\)th iterate?
      </li>
    </ol>
    Although the first is unsolved, we've made some progress;
    it turns out that if \(d=3\), \(d=4\), or \(d\equiv 2\ (\text{mod } 4)\), then there are infinitely many rational, monic, degree-\(d\) polynomials with newly reducible second iterate!
    Additionally, this result still holds if we require the polynomials to have integer coefficients.
    For other \(d>1\), it is completely unknown how many such polynomials exist.



    <h2>Quadratic Polynomials with Newly Reducible Second Iterate</h2>

    <p>
      In this section I give a proof that there are infinitely many polynomials of the form \( x^2 + ax + b \) with newly reducible second iterates.
      This result isn't too difficult to prove, but it is fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let \(f(x) = (x-\gamma)^2 + m + \gamma\), for \(m,\gamma\in\mathbb{Q}\).
      This is equivalent to the form \(f(x) = x^2 + ax + b\), but it makes iterates nicer.
      Then \(f\) factors uniquely over \(\mathbb{C}\) as \(f(x) = (x+\sqrt{-m-\gamma})(x-\sqrt{-m-\gamma})\), and thus \(f(x)\) is reducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\) if and only if \(-m-\gamma\) is a rational square.
      So if we want newly reducible second iterates, we need \(-m-\gamma\) to not be a square.<br />
      Also, note that \( f(x) \) is reducible if and only if \( f(x+\gamma) \) is reducible &mdash; so we will use these statements interchangeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's suppose \(f^2(x)\) is newly reducible, and see what that tells us about \(m\) and \(\gamma\). If \(f^2(x)\) is newly reducible, we can write it as
      <p class="centered">
        \( f^2(x) = \left((x-\gamma)^2 + b_1(x-\gamma) + a_1\right)\left((x-\gamma)^2 - b_2(x-\gamma) + a_2\right). \)
      </p>
      For some rational \(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2\). We're ignoring the possibility that \(f^2(x) = (\text{degree }1\text{ factor})(\text{degree }3\text{ factor})\),
      because it turns out that this cannot actually happen when \(f(x)\) is irreducible (if you know a bit of field theory, a more general statement can be proven).
      On the other hand, we also know that
      <p class="centered">
        \( \begin{align*}
          f^2(x)  &= f(f(x)) \\
                  &= \left( (x-\gamma)^2 + m + \gamma - \gamma \right)^2 + m + \gamma \\
                  &= (x-\gamma)^4 + 2m(x-\gamma) + m^2 + m + \gamma.
        \end{align*} \)
      </p>
      We then equate the coefficients of \((x-\gamma)\) in these two expressions to get the following system of equations:
      <p class="centered">
        \(\begin{align}
          m^2+m+\gamma  &= a_1a_2 \\
          0             &= a_1b_2 + a_2b_1 \\
          2m            &= a_1 + a_2 + b_1b_2 \\
          0             &= b_1 + b_2
        \end{align}\)
      </p>
      Substituting \( -b_1 \) for \( b_2 \) gives
      <p class="centered">
        \(\begin{align}
          m^2+m+\gamma  &= a_1a_2 \\
          0             &= -a_1b_1 + a_2b_1 \\
          2m            &= a_1 + a_2 - b_1^2
        \end{align}\)
      </p>
      Now we would like to divide the second equation by \(b_1\), but it may be zero.
      Well, suppose that it is. Then solving the remaining equations for \(m\) and \(\gamma\), and plugging these values into \(f(x)\),
      shows that
      <p class="centered">
        \( f(x+\gamma) = \frac{1}{4}(2x - a_1 + a_2)(2x + a_1 - a_2) \),
      </p>
      and this contradicts our assumption that \(f^2\) is <i>newly</i> reducible. Therefore, \(b_1\neq 0\).
      Then we have \( a_1 = a_2 \), and solving the remaining two equations gives
      <p class="centered">
        \( m = \frac{1}{2} \left(2 a_1-b_1^2\right), \qquad
        \gamma = \frac{1}{4} \left(4 a_1 b_1^2-4 a_1-b_1^4+2 b_1^2\right) \tag{$\ast$} \)
      </p>
      Now we have proven the following statement: If \( f(x) \) has a newly reducible second iterate, then there exist rational \( a_1,b_1 \) such that equations \( (\ast) \) hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about the converse? Suppose we do have \( m,\gamma,a_1,b_1 \) such that equations \( (\ast) \) hold.
      Then
      <p class="centered">
        \(\begin{align*}
          f(x+\gamma)   &= x^2 + a_1 b_1^2 - \frac{1}{4} b_1^4, \\
          f^2(x+\gamma) &= \left(x^2+b_1 x+a_1\right) \left(x^2-b_1 x+a_1\right).
        \end{align*}\)
      </p>
      We find that \( f^2(x) \) is in fact reducible for all \(a_1\) and \(b_1\)!
      To determine when it is newly reducible, we look at when \(f(x)\) is irreducible &mdash;
      recall that this happens exactly when \(-m-\gamma\) is not a square. In our case, we have
      <p class="centered">
        \( -m-\gamma = - a_1 b_1^2 + \frac{1}{4} b_1^4 \)
      </p>
      And we can find infinitely many \( a_1,b_1 \) such that this is not the square of a rational number.
      For instance, let \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \) be integers equivalent to \(2\) modulo \(3\), and note that \( -m-\gamma \) is a square if and only if \( 4(-m-\gamma) \) is a square.
      Then we have \( -4 a_1 b_1^2 + b_1^4 \equiv 2\ (\text{mod }3). \)
      This is not the square of an integer, since each integer square is either \(0\) or \(1\) mod \(3\).
      Thus, since it is an integer, it is also not the square of a rational number.
      Therefore, \( f^2(x) \) is newly reducible for all such \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \)!
